      <p style="overflow: auto;">
        <b>Bardic Inspiration</b>: As a bonus action, a creature in 60 ft that can hear me gets an inspiration die (d8)(max 1). For 10 min, the recipient can add it to one ability check, attack roll, or saving throw. This addition can be done after
        seeing the d20 roll, but before knowing the outcome. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Charisma modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a Short Rest<br />

        a Bardic Inspiration die. The roll of that die is added to the weapon's damage, in addition to one of the following: <ul>
          <li>
            <i>Defensive Flourish:</i> The result is also added to my AC until the start of my next turn </li>
