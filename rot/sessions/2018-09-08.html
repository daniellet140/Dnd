<h2>Session 2018-09-08</h2>
<hr />

<a href="2018-09-03.html">Prev.</a>
<<p>We continue our explorations through the caves. We run across a hulking blue figure which looks extremely similar to trolls but naked. We find a room which is oppressively cold. The floor has drag marks that seem to go in and out of the room.</p>
<p>We find a large shelter built like a dessert tent that looks like it is from the area that MacCath is from. She is inside unharmed. She tells us that the Daakhorn is not here anymore. It left with humans with a half-dragon almost a year ago. She is here studying the lost scrolls of the arcane brotherhood. She has been kept alive to decode the scrolls then she would be used a gift for his mate. </p>
<p>We rest, then head into the cave below and fight the dragon. Grunt take a potion of growth and becomes super huge Grunt. They fight valiantly, but the dragon manages to escape. Hazidrawn attacks Grunt because she is unable to kill him. </p>
